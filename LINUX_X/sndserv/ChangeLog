	* If the DSP device is busy or no sound card available
	  sndserver now continues to work, just without playing
	  the sounds. So XDoom continues to work too in this case
	  and doesn't terminate anymore.

	* 8 bit sound support improved like done for the xdoom
	  builtin sound handling, see xdoom's log file too.

	* Ported to Unixware 7.

Mon Jan 26 13:03:35 1998	<udo@umserver.umnet.de>

	* Added test for environment variable DOOM_SOUND_SAMPLEBITS
	  to override detection of a 16bit sound card and activate
	  conversion to 8bit sound samples. There are 16bit sound
	  cards which aren't SoundBlaster compatible and changing
	  the sources to force it playing 8bit samples worked with
	  this sound card. I added this environment variable,
	  so people won't need to modify the source anymore.

	* Support for tnt.wad and plutonia.wad added

	* Changed order so that sndserver looks for the WADs
	  in the same order then xdoom does.

	* This ChangeLog added, who knows how much work will
	  be done here, so it's better to have separate log
	  for sndserver too.

	* The sound card initialization sequence was the opposite
	  as the 4Front OSS documentation says, how this should
	  be done. It might cause problems with some sound cards,
	  I don't know, I just fixed it and it's a better style
	  anyway to coincide with documented API's.

Wed Dec 31 1997			<udo@umserver.umnet.de>

	* Sound support for 8bit sound cards added. The server
	  detected the sample format capabilities of the sound
	  hardware already and the conversion from the signed
	  short sounds samples to 8bit unsigned is pretty easy
	  to do. Also I modified the text output, so that it
	  just shows which type of card it's using, instead of
	  the original error message, if the hardware isn't
	  able to play the 16bit signed samples.
	  This should work with all PC UNIX's, but I have tested
	  it under UW 2.1.2 only, because that is the only system
	  I have with old 8bit sound hardware.
