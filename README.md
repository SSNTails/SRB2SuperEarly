# Sonic Robo Blast 2
#### September 14, 1999 Source Code
#### Release by SSNTails ( www.youtube.com/@ssntails )
#### https://github.com/SSNTails/SRB2SuperEarly
#### Special thanks to Saxman for preservation!

Here is a VERY early copy of the source code that I sent to my friend Saxman on September 14, 1999. It is so early, it is almost stock Doom Legacy v1.28. You can find edits made by searching for the string "Tails".

#### Unlike the February 2000 Prototype, this code HAS NOT been modified to function on modern systems!

I believe it is possible to pull the February 2000 prototype backwards to be compatible with this source code.

#### Pull Requests are welcome! Want to fix a bug? Add the new SDL2 layer? Those are just a few ideas.
