 [1] INTRODUCTION
 ----------------

 Legacy is more and more heading towards new editing possibilities.
 We took time before starting thinking of adding linedefs, new object
 types, ect, because we prefer to have a good strong base, before adding
 new editing features.

 With the console, better network, and overal improved compatibility with
 the existing Doom wads, we feel that Legacy has reached the maturity
 for extending the engine. That's what we could call the end of 'phase 1'..


 [1-1]: Future plans
 ===================

     Adding new editing features will be a lot of work, especially because
     editing tools will be needed. For example, to add the water in the
     existing maps, will need a simple editor to view a map, and edit
     sector/linedefs/things properties.

     We could use the existing map editors, but there is a limit to it.
     We will cooperate with other ports as much as we can and use common
     thing types, sector types ect.

     We will possibly create NEW resources, associated with maps. Those
     resources will contain the additional information used by Legacy,
     and will be ignored by the original Doom and ports that don't support
     it. Thus, it will not interfere with the thing/linedefs numbers
     chosen by other ports.

     NEW: As of 25-Aug-1998, we can now tell you that we have an editor
          in progress. It will rock :) the interface already does.


 ---------------------------
 [2] SPRITES/FLATS IN A PWAD
 ---------------------------

     Replacing the sprites graphics in Doom has always been difficult.
     Only 1% of the existing maps for Doom and Doom2 use new sprite
     graphics : because Doom didn't support sprites replacements direc-
     tly in a pwad, you had to create a 3mb wad with ALL the original
     sprites of Doom, and replacing the ones you wanted. For distri-
     bution of your creation, you had to create a batch installation
     file, and use programs like Deutex or Nwt to put all the missing
     sprites in the pwad before the end-user could play with it.

     Personally, if I had sprites in pwad directly supported in the
     original Doom, I'd have already created a lot of maps with new
     sprites graphics : how many times I wanted to draw some specific
     sprites to fit in a map's theme..

     Sprites and flats in pwad is now the 'standard' of Doom Legacy,
     there is no command line options, so have fun with it!

     SPRITES and FLATS in pwad _ARE_ supported by the 'addfile' console
     command (loading pwad at run time). 

     Soon TEXTURES will be supported at run-time by the 'map' command.



 [2-1]: Using SPRITES in a pwad
 ==============================

     It is not need anymore to append the missing sprites in a pwad
     (using deutex or nwt).

  >> You need only 'S_END' (or SS_END) added after the last sprite
     in your pwad.

  >> S_START (or SS_START) is not obligatory, but is advised : to
     clearly separate sprites from skin sprites, and other sections
     that might redefine the same sprite, but for other uses.

     The best is to put S_START and S_END.

     All sprite resources found in pwad, will replace those loaded
     before, just like with any other resources. Thus, sprites in
     pwad replace the original sprites of Doom, since the original
     game wad is always the first one.

  >> If you put S_END, but not S_START, sprites will be searched
     from the beginning of the pwad, up to the S_END.

     We could get rid of S_END, but the loading of sprites would
     be less efficient.

  !> Another reason for section markers (S_START, S_END) : sprites
     resources are recognised by their 4 first letters. For example
     player sprites start with 'PLAY'. Suppose you replace the
     'PLAYPAL' resource in a pwad, and use sprites in it, if you
     don't put the S_START, and 'PLAYPAL' is BEFORE the sprites,
     it will be taken as a sprite since it starts with 'PLAY'.
     Solution: always put S_START/S_END, or put 'PLAYPAL' resource
     AFTER S_END.

     This is a reason why section markers are still useful.

  >> Even better: you can replace only some frames of a sprite in
     a pwad: example is replacing PUNGA0, but not PUNGB0, ..
     this DOES NOT work using sprite renaming with dehacked. So
     I really encourage you now to use sprites in pwad directly
     instead of dehacked sprite renaming. This is useful for the
     rocket for example, where you want to replace only the
     missile or only the explosion.



 [2-2]: Compatibility with older patches
 =======================================

     For direct support of existing patches, SS_START is considered
     as 'S_START', and 'SS_END' will be considered as S_END.

     Also, for support of the (very old) dmadds pwads, empty sprite
     resources of 8bytes length are ignored (for dmadds, it meant
     use the original sprite of Doom)

     List of patches I have tested that fully worked:

      QUEST, CHOOKS, BUNNY3D, TOONS, SIMPSONS, ALIENSTC, ANUBIS,
      STARWARS, DOLL, CRINGE, D2XGOLD, DFRIFLE, ect..

     Several ones used dehacked to change the weapons, so I converted
     the old .deh to the latest format simply loading and saving it
     under Dehacked3.0, then added it with -dehacked command line.
     It all worked fine.



 [2-3]: Using FLATS in a pwad
 ============================

     Flats in a pwad already worked with the original Doom, you had
     to put a 'F_END' after the last flat. However, it wasted
     memory because the engine took all resources from the F_START
     of the original game wad, up to the F_END in your pwad, as
     flats.

  >> Section markers are not needed at all for the FLATS. You can
     get rid of the F_END in a pwad, because only those flats
     used in the current map are loaded. Since FLAT names are
     8 chars, they are uniquely identified in the wad files, and
     they don't need section markers.

  >> You might want to add a F_END after the last flat, for ports
     that don't support this, and for the original Doom games.

     Flats loading is now different : it supports any number of new
     flats (using new names), and it only animates those animated
     flats that are used in a level. YES, this is a feature, because
     soon you will be able to define as many animated flat sequences
     as you will.



 -----------------------
 [3] DOOM3.WAD RESOURCES
 -----------------------

 Don't fear to use custom graphics to replace Legacy's ones, other ports
 will simply ignore these resources, so you can create a wadfile with
 new status bar overlay icons for example, that will work with the
 original Doom.



 [3-1]: Patch resources
 ======================

  RANKINGS : the graphic displayed at the top of the deathmatch
	     rankings (while in a net-game).

  RSKY1
  RSKY2
  RSKY3 : the sky graphics are now 256x240, not 256x128.

	  that's because of the freelook : you are able to look
	  higher, thus seeing a part of the sky you couldn't see
	  in the original Doom.

	  Using a taller graphic is better than scaling up the
	  original skies, it looks better. However for compatibility,
	  Legacy scales up the SKY textures if it finds that they
	  are the 'old' small size 256x128.

	  Use the LUMPY utility provided in this archive to create
	  patches for the sky. See the provided SKY2403.PCX for
	  an example.

		   The bottom 40 lines are under the horizon and not
		   normally seen. The lines 100 to 199 are the ones
		   you see while looking straight ahead. The top lines
		   0-99 are the lines of sky you see when looking up.

	  To convert the sky:

	  LUMPY sky2403.pcx -width 256 -heigth 240

	  Then use NWT or DEUTEX to insert the raw file into the
	  RSKY resources.

	     Example: with NWT place the cursor on RSKY1, and use
		      the 'import raw to pwad' key, enter 'rsky1.raw'
		      and then 'newsky.wad' as destination wad.

	  Note: if like me, you love Deluxe Paint, you'll have to use
	  the 'old' DP instead of DPA, to be able to edit graphics
	  taller than 320x200.


 [3-2]: Pic resources
 ====================

 You must use lumpy to create pic_t resources, see LUMPY.TXT for more
 about using lumpy. pic_t resources are used for the following in
 Doom Legacy:

  CONSBACK - console back picture, 320x200, when 'con_backpic' is true
					    (the console variable)
	     also used as the loading picture

	     MUST BE 200 lines high, can be any width (default is 320)

  CBLEFT   - console left border, used with translucent console background
	     MUST BE 200 lines high, any width (default is 8)

  CBRIGHT  - console rigth border, used with translucent console background
	     MUST BE 200 lines high, any width (default is 8)


 Status Bar Overlay icons (all 16x16 pixels):

  SBOHEALT - health (default shows a red cross)
  SBOFRAGS - frags (default shows a skull)
  SBOARMOR - armor (default shows a green armor)

  SBOAMMO1 - pistol ammo
  SBOAMMO2 - shotgun ammo
  SBOAMMO3 - chaingun ammo
  SBOAMMO4 - rocket ammo
  SBOAMMO5 - plasma ammo
  SBOAMMO6 - bfg ammo
  SBOAMMO8 - super shotgun ammo



 ---------
 [4] SOUND
 ---------

 We have not added sound features right now. Well, to be honest
 the sound quality is now much better. This is due partly to:

     - the fantastic Allegro library by Shawn Hargreaves, we use
       its sound routines,
     - some rework by Boris, to set the volume with much more
       precision at a hardware level instead of software.

 Well, at least on a SB16 you will hear the difference, using the
 original Doom, the sounds are 'muffled'.



 ---------
 [5] MUSIC
 ---------

 Doom LEGACY supports direct playing of midi files. It's not
 necessary to convert them to MUS. This is not really a feature,
 except there may be some MIDs that doesn't sound well with MUS.

 If you wanna play, just insert a .MID file as a raw resource with
 NWT, in place of any D_xxxx mus resource. Doom LEGACY will recognize
 the MID.
