		      players and see two of them
    - '-connect' have changed, without parameter it will autodetect a local
      neighbour server
    - now server will send filename, to allow the joiners to load it before play,
      it is realy interesting feature because now client don't must put the same wad list.

   Editing

      texture storing scheme of Legacy.
    - added transparent texture support. See Editing.txt

   Bugfixes

 Doom Legacy Update v1.25  25-Aug-1998:
 ======================================

    NOTE! The chasecam key is now '/' slash on the keypad, and it
	  is available only in '-devparm' mode.

    - SKINS !!! : a skin is basically a full sprite replacement
      for the player, with optional specific sounds (hurt, death,
      jump etc..) and optional status bar face to go with it.

      Skins are simple wad files, that can be added with '-file'
      on the command line, and you can have as many skins as you
      want into a wadfile, so prepare for skinspacks galore!

      With Doomatic (our deathmatch launcher), the copying of
      files to other players is automatic, so the skins are
      automatically copied to other players. Using your pre-
      ferred deathmatch launcher, just make sure everybody
      have the skins wads.

      Skins work in single player too, you can admire your skin
      while in chasecam mode (use '/' slash key on keypad while
      in -devparm mode).

    - TEAMPLAY and TEAMSKIN deathmatch modes : you know about
      teamplay, teamskin is like teamplay, but using skins to
      identify teams instead of the color. Of course the frag
      rankings and intermission are updated to show team scores.
      Plus, there's a 'teamdamage' console variable that allows
      to choose whether your team partners get hurt when you
      shoot'em or not. Quake's teamplay is Legacy's teamplay
      with 'teamdamage' at 0.

      Cool! 'teamdamage' also works in cooperative, so in
      cooperative you can choose whether you can hurt your
      coop partners or not.

      Like in Quake, the armor is always damaged in teamplay
      if you hurt your partners.

      When you are hurt by a partner, and teamdamage is off,
      you won't see blood and the screen won't go red.

    - NETWORK IMPROVED : the 'slow turn' seems to be fixed now.
      Even better, we can call this the 'angle-turn client
      prediction' as your view now moves _before_ the server
      receives it. As you move around the view quicly in multiplayer,
      it is now smoother, especially in higher resolutions.
      Please tell us how you feel the improvement!


    Console:
    --------
    - viewheight : set the height of view, if you want to see what a Leprechaun
		   sees, just lower that! It's good to frag those giant marines
		   when you're a little teeny-weeny Leprechaun, heheheeee
    - skin,teamplay,teamdamage : for teamplay modes
    - frags,teamfrags : these shows the original Doom frag table, and also for
			teams vs teams !
    - memfree,help : see what memory is used in Doom's heap, see how much physical
		     memory is left after you run Legacy.
    - addfile : completes 'map' command, loads external pwads at run time, currently
		able to load the sprites, sounds, musics, flats, and maps,... but
		not new textures (to do). Also to do is load the skins in pwads
		at run time.

    Editing:
    --------
    - 'hall of mirrors' removed (thanks to Demiurg and his cool rivbrid.wad which looks really nice)

    - visplanes limit increased (should be plenty) (thanks to Russel and his huge pract.wad that
      broke Legacy's 256 drawsegs and 256 visplanes with... up to 896 drawsegs at once (2sided lines),
      and 380+ visplanes when flying above the map with 'IDFLY' !!!)


    Misc:
    -----
    - dehacked patches files with .DEH extension can be added
      after '-file', which makes it very easy to use patches
      with your usual deathmatch launcher (it doesn't have
      to know about the dehacked, then, and Doomatic will
      copy the dehacked patches automatically since it is
      part of the wad files).

    - end sequence (finale) fixed for higher resolutions
      (thanks Kege)

    - 'splash' sounds when walking and jumping in water

    - can't cheat anymore by jumping in dangerous fluids to
      avoid the damage as it does more damage now.
      This makes a lot of deathtag levels playable again
      with Legacy (as lava was used to prevent scoring unless
      you have got the 'steel boots' armor)

    - testing deathmatch maps alone using '-deathmatch -warp'
      didn't work in last version, now fixed

    - that horrible 'SIGSEGV' bug due to a faulty CD-library,
      fixed.

    - other little goodies you'll find yourself...



 Doom Legacy Update v1.24  19-July-1998:
 =======================================

    - added CD Audio music, along with console commands 'play','stop',
      'info', etc. CD Music volume is in the sounds menu (F4).

      Note: cd audio and midi music are separate, and can be active
	    at the same time. This is useful if, like me, you have
	    some 'ambiance sound' cd's like sounds of storm, rain..
	    you can use it to add ambiance, while still listening to
	    the midi music.

	    Usually, you will want to turn either the music or CD
	    audio volume to zero.

    - some minor changes in the network, we noticed a serious problem
      with FAST machines & SLOW network cards, seems to work fine now.
    - fixed the backspace problem in the chat
    - fixed problem with some playback of lmp version 1.20
    - warp parameter work again with doom1 and ultimate
    - fixed switch textures that didn't 'switch' in ultimate doom.
    - fixed stupid bug with the statusbar numbers not refreshing.
    - the 'map' console command now works in multiplayer.
    - blood sprite changed so it looks better when staying longer
    - bloodtime is now a network variable, the server sets it for
      everybody
    - added gravity variable


 Doom Legacy Update v1.23  17-July-1998:
 =======================================

    - this version was a 'source release' for some projects, it was
      a work in progress, not released on the site.


 Doom Legacy Update v1.22  5-Jun-1998:
 =====================================

    - the slow turning left & right is fixed. Sorry we have forget to
      put the right code in the release.
    - added command "say" and "sayto". This fix chat problem.
    - word wraping in the console.
    - fixed problems with the new head up display.
    - fixed shift key problem.


 Doom Legacy Update v1.21 25-May-1998:
 =====================================

 Network:
    - the slow turning left & right is fixed
    - playing back demos of the latest version, along with the support
      for v1.12 demos didn't work : fixed. If you happened to record
      demos and thought they didn't work, they will now playback cor-
      rectly as they were recorded properly.
    - now SERSETUP works.. but more work need to be done, especially
      testing it , so please mail us how it worked for U !!
      Check LEGACY.TXT section 5/6 for more.

 Video:
    - fixed a nasty bug with getting the vesa extended modes. On some
      cards like Matrox Millenium it either showed less video modes,
      or didn't work at all.

 Misc:
    - fixed 'netgame' name used for savegames sometimes.
    - starting a game with more players than deathmatch starts will
      not crash anymore.. but some players will be spawned at the
      same point and will be stuck (yes it is a quickfix, this
      problem arises only at the very beginning of the game,
      usually there is always a dm start free)
    - the demons are opaque.. and the spectres translucent.
    - removed the "F***" word from fragging messages by request



 Release v1.20 Undocumented:
 ===========================
    - Doom Legacy supports 64 deathmatch starts (the original game
      used up to 10 dmstarts)

    - height checks added for melee attacks: so monsters can't hit you
      if they are not on the same level, when using short range attacks.

    - when you are under Invisibility (blur sphere) and it is running out,
      you will switch between hi translucency and low translucency, and
      only when the invisibility is fully finished, you become opaque.

    - Supports FLATS and SPRITES in pwad, from the very old 'dmadds' pwads
      up to the latest dehacked patches using sprite renaming.

      See EDITING.TXT for more about using sprites/flats in pwad.

    - Can replace only some frames of a sprite in a pwad.

    - Sprites/Textures in a pwad are not supported at run-time using
      the map command, to do. Flats in pwad work at run-time.

    - the automap displays the right player colors

    - savegame buffer upped to 512kb

    - supports multiple dehacked eg: -dehacked one.deh two.deh three.deh

    - supports DIGMID (digital midi) using the sound.cfg



 Release 1.20 Updated 19-May-98:
 ===============================

 NOTE: THIS IS NOT COMPLETE AT ALL, WE WILL DOCUMENT THE CHANGES OF
       VERSION 1.2 AS SOON AS POSSIBLE, THERE ARE MANY ONES! BUT WE
       GOTTA RELEASE..

 Engine/Game:
    - Added the Doom Console! Enter commands and change game var-
      iables at any time! If you are not used to it, the console
      will allow you to be a 'Doom power user' ! We have worked
      a lot on the console itself, and have implemented a basic
      set of commands and variables. In the future we will be
      able to add any kind of commands easily. Any command or
      variable that you'd like? We are open to suggestions.

      Check the console section for more about all the commands
      available.

    - Finally improved and fixed the translucency on sprites:
      - the spectres (pink like demons) are really hard to see
      - translucency on torches is now correct, only the flame
	part is translucent
      - most projectiles are now brighter : the translucency
	used to diminish the colours intensity, now they look
	as bright as the original game
      - each sprite, and each frame can use a different trans-
	lucency eg: the bullet puffs are more translucent than
	the fireballs, the plasma bullets gets more translucent
	as they disappear
      - the blur sphere will make you as translucent as the
	pink demons, which means very hard to see! So the blur
	sphere item will probably become a strategic weapon!


 Multiplayer/Network:
    - Totally rewritten the network code of Doom : the method
      is now a very basic implementation of Client/Server. It uses
      less transfer, and allow up to 32 players simultaneously.
      Actually there is one drawback : you have to be sure that
      the server is fast enough, and doesn't slowdown, because
      if the server slows down, everybody in the game experience
      the 'lag'.

    - We have cleaned up the intermission screen with the death-
      match scores. It displays now several kinds of rankings,
      including the death rankings :) See Section [5-9] of the
      main documentation.

      We will document these scoring modes better in the future.
      Please note that this was quickly added: we can add any type
      of scoring system provided it's interesting enough, and
      funny :)

    - The deathmatch rankings are now automatically displayed when
      you are dead, until you respawn.



 Demos:
    - When playing back a demo, it tells the name of the player
      you are looking at when pressing F12. It is also displayed
      white in the deathmatch rankings. When you are actually
      playing, it is always YOUR name that is displayed white in
      the deathmatch rankings.


 Miscellaneous:
    - The old sky textures are stretched and displayed right. It
      doesn't look great, but that's better than nothing.
    - The jump key is no more repeatable. If you keep it pressed,
      the marine will jump only once.
    - Restored the sound caching system: if soundprecache is set
      to false, it will not load all the sounds at startup, but
      only when needed.
    - Restored the original game title screen, since there is now
      the Doom Legacy logo at the game startup screen. Phew! I'm
      happy to see that great titlepic of Doom1 back!


 Bugfixes:
    - Items under crushing sectors that could not be picked up is
      fixed. A ridiculous test == should have been <=, arh!
      Fixed the crushing ceilings that didn't crush too.
    - The game can now be started in standard VGA 320*200 on
      older non-vesa graphic cards.
    - Fixed an important bug with memory usage under Windows and
      OS2 systems, please tell is if it works under WinNT !
      We have tested it under OS2 and it works now perfectly!
    - Fixed Win95 asking for 'switch to DOS mode'.


 In development:
    - Started working on hicolor : the engine will use HICOLOR
      textures, instead of simply converting the 256color graphics
      to hicolor.

    - The console border graphics, and the loading screen picture
      were done in a hurry, I have to finish them.

    - Finish that damn water, arh! We have to make a simple editor
      for this. The tools will be developed under Windows.




 Release 1.12 Updated 06-Mar-98:
 ===============================

 As you can see, we've taken some time to write a better docu-
 mentation, we hope you'll appreciate, and read the full doc
 before sending us reports about bugs/trouble shooting.


 Engine/Game:
    - You can now shoot up and down, in the free look direction!
    - You can shoot the ceiling and the floor, and see the puffs
      of smoke.
    - Doom didnt draw the puffs of smoke when shooting on some
      walls in open areas, this is now fixed!
    - Autoaim on/off. When autoaim is off, you can still use the
      freelook to shoot up and down, but only when there's nothing
      to aim in front of you.
    - Crosshair preference : Off, Cross, Angle, or Point. It's drawn
      a little translucent too.
    - Added jump ability, key mappable in the menu of course.
    - Can walk under and over monsters/inanimate objects.
      All Doom things (sprites) are now collision-checked in real 3d,
      thus things can stay on top of other things, monsters and player
      avatar can walk/fly over stacked things and so on...
      Eg: we've tested a 'solid corpse' feature and all the corpses
      were stacking one on another in maps with lots of ennemies!
    - Added transparency on other sprites, as requested : arachno,
      barons, caco and mancubus projectiles, the lost soul, blood
      'puffs', eye in symbol, demon (big boss) spawn fire.

 Multiplayer/Network:
    - You can now frag with the barrels!!! For the frag artists out
      there, now you're rewarded by your talent! Let me explain:
      when you shoot a barrel, and then later one or more guys die
      by the explosion of the barrels, you get the frags!!! This
      works like dominoes too : whatever number of barrels they are,
      they all know who caused the first explosion! Now there should
      be a special deathmatch mode with respawning barrels :) !!!
    - Fixed a bug that MAY have caused some 'consistancy failures'
      with more than 4 players (the more players, the more this bug
      happened).

 Demos:
    - Demos now record the mouse look, change of color, change of
      name, and the messages (talk key) when multiplayer!!
    - Demos now record the timer, so you don't need to set -timer
      when you playback the demo.
    - Demos are somewhat 'compressed' and takes less space.
    - Fixed demos not being recorded when you exited using F10 key.
    - The 'q' key no longer ends a demo recording. Too many times
      someones presses this key by error. Now use 'F10' to end a
      demo (or quit from the menu).
    - Older demos may not run well. We don't like putting a lot of
      dirty code for the sake of backward compatibility. Especially
      now with the mouse aiming, old demos just look crap! They're
      always looking straight ahead! Anyway, before sending your
      bug reports : we're trying all we can to keep the compatibilty,
      we know a lot of old demos don't playback well now... we're
      trying to fix that. For now, just keep your old exes to play
      your old demos!
    - Fixed a bug with demos not recording the right name for the
      Deathmatch Rankings.
    - Demos doesn't record pause now.


 New mappable controls (Setup Controls menu):

    The Setup Controls menu has been reworked. It now accepts a lot
    more combinations. eg: you can now 'Backward' and 'Use' with one
    key.

    - Weapon Keys !!! Map your preferred weapons to easily accessible
      keys!
    - Deathmatch Rankings (it was stuck to 'f', now mappable)
    - Talk key (used to be 't') now mappable.
    - F11 : gamma key is back, I removed the key when I put the gamma
      in the menu, but then I could have let the key. I restored it.
    - Jump key, everybody on da plasma at map01!


 Menus keys remapped:
    - F5 (used to be lowdetail) : since lowdetail is no more useful,
      this key activates the Video Options menu.
    - F7 (used to be endgame) : now calls the main Options menu.

 Miscellaneous:
    - Added joystick support : useless but demanded... so there you
      have it, and since we don't do it half : you have support
      for the 'hat' plus 6 joystick buttons. Check the 'Joystick
      Support' section for more.
    - Removed the translucency from 2sided walls. There still need
      to do an 'editing' support for this, so that new-made levels
      can use it...work in progress.
    - As requested, a '-fuzzy' parameter disables the translucency
      and restores the old spectre 'fuzz' effect. Hey! We DO KNOW
      that translucency is too low on the spectres (ie: too much
      visible), but that's another problem! As we have tested, the
      spectres look MUCH better with a high translucency than with
      the old fuzz effect...
    - Can now use keypad arrows in the menu, as requested.
    - A new cheat to fly around levels, this is NOT FOR MUTLIPLAYER.
      Don't mail us to know about it, we won't tell you!!!
    - Added 'crunchy' sound when a sector crushes a dead corpse :)
    - Restored the ENDOOM screen ('beg' end screen).
    - Ctrl-C no longer interrupts the game, as requested, now use
      Ctrl-Break to cleanly exit at any time.

 Bugfixes:
    - Fixed autodetection of Ultimate Doom, however it stills shows
      'Doom Registered Startup' on the title bar.
    - Some new features like rocket trails were disabled when playing
      back an old demo, but wasn't restored when starting a new game.
      Fixed. (this was a problem with in-game demo sequences)
    - Fixed the problem with people having 'detaillevel 1' in their
      default.cfg. The game exited with an error message.
    - Fixed the messages was offset a little in some resolutions.
    - Fixed the config not saved when playing back or recording
      a demo.
    - Fixed the 'RROCK17' texture not found with Doom1/Doom Ultimate.
    - Fixed a bug with 'french' keymap used when it should not. Now
      use it only for the french version, so you have 'qwerty' keymap
      when entering messages, American people happy?
    - Some other boooring little bugs crushed with our mighty feet.

 In development:
    - Transparent water in development (test it at map30)
      this is unfinished and given as a 'preview shot', if you
      like/dislike please mail us!! We think that it looks
      much better than Quake2's transparent water. If you dont
      think so, mail us, but then please read first the
      following!

      SNEAK PREVIEW HINT:

      To see it, with Doom2, go at map30. Right now, its slower
      than it could be so don't look at the speed, it will be
      done a faster way later.. just wanted to do a fast preview
      so that you can tell us what you think about it!!

      Still to do : all kinds of sounds when walking/jumping into
      water, new colors when underwater, different sound when
      under water, new sprites when shooting into water and so on...

    - Chase cam! Use the 'c' key when in '-devparm' mode to test
      this. Remember: its just a quick addition, unfinished.
      Anyway real cool to look at demos with this.

    - Solid corpses : corpses stack one on another. This will be
      implemented as a multiplayer option for fun deathmatches.

      SNEAK PREVIEW HINT:

      For now, you can test it with the -solidcorpse option.

      Consider this as a quick way to see the new walk over/under
      possibilities.

      New problems arise in this mode, sometimes you're blocked
      by corpses, and there should be a way to clear out the path!

    - Better things-on-top-of-things handling : if you walk over
      a monster and the monster moves, you should move with it.
      That's not implemented right now: if the monster move,
      you fall.

    - Some kind of detection of the old skys, disabling the sky
      from moving when mouse looking or something like that...



 Release 1.11 Updated 14-Feb-98:
 ===============================

    - Full support SVGA : can switch to any VESA2 mode with the good
      aspect ratio, can switch video mode in the menu, save video mode
      in default config
    - We have added - Transparence - , better say 'translucency', which
      replace the old 'partial invisibility' effect. A selection of
      objects are now transparent : BFG and Plasma balls, monsters fireball,
      bullet puff, ...
    - Full setup controls from the game menu, much better than 'setup',
      now you can assign any 'control' to any key/mousebutton or joybutton.
      Assign mouse and keys to anything.
    - Free look : look up and down like Heretic (mouse supported).
    - Multiplayer menu: choose your preferred color and enter your name.
      The name of the players are displayed in the deathmatch rankings,
      and also when receiving messages. You can change your color at any
      time while playing a net game (your name too)!

 Mutliplayers News
    - We have added support for 8 player. We could not test it much, but
      it seems to work fine now.
      Test it, and send us a report if it run great. Thanks.
      However you'll need a deathmatch launcher which supports more
      than 4 players... why not try our great launcher called 'Doomatic'?
    - We have added 7 'deathmatch' colors (for a total 11 colors).
    - We have added 'preferred weapons order'. However we didn't finish
      it at the time you read this, so its not configurable in the menu
      right now , but you can edit the default.cfg (hint)

 Compatibility support
    - can load demos of doom v1.9, some new additions are automatically
      disabled when playing back older demos so that they run fine.
    - Support dehacked patches : use -dehacked <filename.deh>
      If you like superweapons patches, and the like, it should work
      no problem with our support. The difference is that now you don't
      need  to patch the exe.

 Minor news
    - play demos from any directory (eg: -playdemo demos\cooldemo)
    - show player's statusbar and hear player's sounds when changing the
      viewpoint while looking at a demo (F12)
    - autorun toggle (menu)
    - mouselook toggle (menu)
    - mouselook y sensitivity (menu)
    - invert mouse for mouselook (menu)
    - Load MIDI file in wad (autodetect if is MUS or MID)
      This one is for you wad creators : just insert a MID as a raw
      file in place of a 'D_XXXX' resource and it works.
    - Some network optimisations (but run only with doomatic).

 Know bugs:
    - Yes, there's transparency on 2sided walls, but be reassured, this
      is a simple 'quicktest' feature, to see what it looks like,
      we've left it until the next version so that you can see it.
    - When a 'marine' is translucent (pickup blur sphere), it looks
      like a green marine... instead of using the player color. todo..
    - You'll have only access to 320x200 video mode, if you don't run
      a VESA2 driver (we don't support mode-X VGA 'tweaked' modes...)
      UNIVBE is recommended, you can use S3VBE20 (freeware) if you have
      an S3 card..
    - automap is not aspect ratio correct in modes like 320x400
    - the intermission screen might display garbage or even crash the game,
      when playing more than 4 players
    - if you use Doomatic : we added the name and preferred colors in
      Doomatic, at that time doom sources were not released... but now
      that we have added name and color in Doom LEGACY, these settings in
      Doomatic don't have effect
    - no win95 specific code, we might do a simple support for win95,
      eg: a setup/launcher program. If you really need something for w95,
      try to convince us!!
    - no waitvbl (no pageflipping)
