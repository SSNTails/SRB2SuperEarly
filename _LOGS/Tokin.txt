- added a check in I_ZoneBase to check if malloc is OK
- the program should check to see if musserv and llsndsrv is not in "."
  because root don't have "." in there path
- sendto function under linux return "connection refuse" if there is no
  server at this address (i have just ignored this error)
- the can be recursive error (especialy in network since Q_Netgame try
  to close the connection ) when closing with I_Error, you should implement
  a recursive error detetion like in DOS or WIN32 version
- now use vid_mode is in vid_s struct
